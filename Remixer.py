# this programm takes a source file of which you have to provide the path to
# it finds all the words in the file strips the file of them and puts them back in
# but in a completly random order
# braces stay in their places also everything which isn't a word
# it returns the result in a .txt file, that has otherwise the same name as the source file
# used on a pythonsode-file the result can be quite funny


# to make it work i had to take the backrefs folder out of the original directory and into the same directory as this .py file
# probably unnecessary but I don't know how to improve on it right now ( 27.10.2017 )
